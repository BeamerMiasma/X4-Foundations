To facilitate this grand expansionary effort, the newly discovered system was to be transformed into a densely colonised foothold; an initiative that was selflessly supported by many of the more influential, wealthy families of Argon Prime. After an initial dispute over equitable distribution of real estate which was settled by the Federal Presidency, officially tying these entitlements to unalterable obligations as part of the colonisation process, the system saw a steady influx of settlers. However, just a few months later, the spotlight of attention shifted away from the once-promising colony. As more and more gates began to reopen, federal interest in The Reach rapidly dwindled, transforming it into the quiescent backwater system of today. To budding explorers and entrepreneurs, this new status carries with it a number of obvious benefits, most notably including an as yet comfortable distance to any military threats, which allows them to test their skills in a relatively forgiving environment.

"cluster_113_macro",-105000000,0,-60620000,"Segaris","During the Second Terraformer war, the people of Terranova fled their planet after the Xenon wreaked havoc on the ecosystem and made it unable to sustain life. Oddly, the Xenon attacks did little damage to the man-made structures there, and much of New Portsmouth, Terranovas principle settlement, was preserved. Many artefacts of daily life were left behind by those fleeing the planet at short notice.<br><br>Now, the Segaris Pioneers are looking to reclaim Terranova for themselves, hoping that the artificial structures of New Portsmouth may offer some shelter from the harsh planetary environment. Alongside the debris and household items, many scientific and technical instruments were left behind, and the Pioneers hope to salvage and repurpose them for their own goals.","terran"
"cluster_114_macro",-120000000,0,-69280000,"Gaian Prophecy","Gaian Prophecy was first discovered by Pioneer Initiative explorers venturing out of Brennans Triumph. Soon after its discovery, it became a refuge for those Segaris Pioneers who were looking for a relatively secluded place to settle; this location fit the bill, as it was the only system in their territory which did not directly border any of the other established factions. More recently, as trade relations between the Antigone Republic and the Terran Protectorate have stabilised, the system has registered an increase in trade ships passing through on the way to their destinations.<br><br>The name of the system derives from its principle planet, Sutton, on which Pioneer scientists were able to observe many of the basic conditions that make colonisation possible. Initially, many Pioneers had hoped they had found a new home for their people on this Earth-analogue, but settling the planet turned out to be a much greater challenge than expected.","terran"
"cluster_115_macro",-135000000,0,-60620000,"Brennan's Triumph","Originally connected to Earth via a Jump Gate, Brennans Triumphs most significant planet, Taurus, was the first planet outside the Sol system to be colonised by human explorers. When they lost contact with Earth, most of these settlers would eventually travel further into the gate network to establish a government in Argon Prime.<br><br>After the systems invasion and the tragic razing of Taurus during the First Terraformer War, the surviving colonists fled, leaving the system uninhabited. When the Xenon were pushed out of the system, Brennans Triumph became a haven for piracy - most notably the organised slave trade - much to the dismay of the Argon Federation, who repeatedly attempted to put an end to this criminal activity. While the Argon Federation failed to regain control of the system, the Jump Gate shutdown would prove disastrous for the resident pirate groups. Since their economy relied exclusively on raiding neighbouring system, it completely collapsed when those systems became inaccessible.<br><br>When the Terran government established a new connection between Neptune and Brennans Triumph, they sent the Pioneer Initiative in to colonise the system. Now, the Segaris Pioneers are happy to have claimed it for themselves, despite its troubled history.","terran"

"cluster_500_macro",0,0,17320000,"Avarice","Some time before the Jump Gate shutdown, the Avarice system was sold by its original owner, a Teladi business, because it turned out to be a poor investment. The new owner, a company which acquired it comparatively cheaply, initially managed to turn a profit from this unexceptional system. After the network shut down, however, the company was unable to trade with other systems, and soon fell apart. Its assets were redistributed to help the people of Avarice cope with their new situation.<br><br>Nowadays, the systems most outstanding, and devastatingly dangerous, feature is the Tide phenomenon. This first manifested itself in the year 800 (NT), and brought with it an increase in stellar output. This first Tide occurred without prior warning and caught the Riptide Rakers unawares, decimating large parts of their population and leaving chaos in its wake. The people of Avarice would eventually learn how to endure the destructive force, but it remains ever-present. Life has adapted to the extraordinary phenomenon, with the inhabitants even learning to use the increased solar output to power efficient recycling systems and fuel their unique economy. Although the Riptide Rakers do trade with other groups, visitors from outside the system are a fairly rare occurrence, deterred by both the Tide phenomenon and the need to travel through pirate-infested space to reach Avarice.","argon"
"cluster_501_macro",0,0,34650000,"Windfall","Even before the Jump Gate shutdown, the Windfall system was renowned for being home to some of the most affluent communities in the network, including captains of industry and the upper classes. These people were initially drawn to Windfall, and established their luxurious residences here, partly because it was an autonomous system connected to both Teladi and Argon space, but also to take advantage of its unique and attractive vistas. Their immense wealth came with a considerable amount of political influence. As a result, the elites inhabiting the system managed to avoid conforming to regulations or paying taxes, while still maintaining good relations with, and easy access to, both neighbouring markets. Since these communities were incredibly wealthy, they could also afford to hire private security forces to keep piracy at bay. Gambling and other indulgences were commonplace, and the system developed an extensive leisure industry.<br><br>When the connection between Windfall and its surrounding systems was severed, the community that had formed wanted for nothing. They had food and money aplenty, and while the resources in the system were not well suited for maintaining large scale industry, that was not an immediate concern. Cut off from any potential outside danger, they lived a life of luxury, and every station was a haven of arts and culture, clubs and casinos. Although these communities were now safe from outside threats, these luxury industries had generated a seedy underbelly that had long attracted all sorts of disreputable people, and an infection was festering from within. Isolated, with nothing but time and money on their hands, it was not long before rogue security forces, small time crooks, and racketeers of all sorts, fought over control of these stations and their markets. The most prominent of these organisations would eventually become the Vigor Syndicate, which presided over Windfalls descent from an unregulated haven of the arts into a lawless, vicious place.","argon"
